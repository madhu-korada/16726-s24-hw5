## Part 1: Inverting the Generator 

### 

Show some example outputs of your image reconstruction efforts using (1) various combinations of the losses including Lp loss, Preceptual loss and/or regularization loss that penalizes L2 norm of delta, (2) different generative models including vanilla GAN, StyleGAN, and (3) different latent space (latent code in z space, w space, and w+ space). Give comments on why the various outputs look how they do. Which combination gives you the best result and how fast your method performs.
